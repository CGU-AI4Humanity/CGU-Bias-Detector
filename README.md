# CGU-Bias-Detector
This bias detector is custom tuned for moderating the use of LLM tools in a university setting. Contributions welcome!

## Project YantraEthica: Claremont Graduate University Research Initiative
## Comprehensive AI Bias Detection and Mitigation Research Program
# Executive Summary
Project YantraEthica (combining Sanskrit “Yantra” meaning machine with “Ethica” for ethical) represents a strategic university research initiative designed to establish foundational capabilities in comprehensive AI bias detection and mitigation. With a modest seed funding, this project will leverage the expertise of a core team supplemented by graduate student developers to create open-source tools and conduct pioneering research across the entire AI lifecycle.
This initiative serves as a critical stepping stone toward the larger research/commercial opportunity, allowing the team to develop technical expertise, validate research approaches, and create intellectual property while building academic credibility in the AI ethics space. We welcome contributions not only from CGU, but from the 7c's and beyond. Our ultimate goal is to invite contributors from across the world, both academic and commercial, to build with us and address this important gap. The ultimate aim is to make the use of AI **ethical**, and provide the tooling to make that happen in the real world.

# Project Scope and Objectives
## Primary Research Goals
1.	Develop Novel Bias Detection Algorithms for training, testing, and runtime phases
2.	Create Open-Source Tools that integrate with existing ML frameworks
3.	Advance Explainability Techniques specifically for bias detection contexts
4.	Build Academic Credibility through publications and conference presentations
5.	Validate Technical Approaches before commercial development
## Key Research Questions
### How can bias detection be seamlessly integrated across the entire ML lifecycle?
### What novel explainability methods can specifically illuminate bias sources?
### How can real-time bias monitoring be implemented efficiently in production systems?
### What are the gaps in current open-source bias detection frameworks?
# Technology Focus Areas and Existing Gaps
## 1. Training Phase Bias Detection
### Current Limitations
#### Most tools focus on post-hoc analysis rather than prevention[1][2]
#### Limited integration with modern ML frameworks like PyTorch 2.0, Transformers
#### Insufficient handling of multimodal data (text + images, structured + unstructured)
### YantraEthica Innovation Focus
#### Real-time data bias detection during training with automated alerts
#### Proxy variable discovery using advanced correlation analysis
#### Synthetic data generation for bias mitigation in underrepresented groups
#### Multi-framework integration (PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX, Hugging Face)
## 2. Testing Phase Bias Auditing
### Current Limitations
#### Limited adversarial testing capabilities for bias detection[3]
#### Insufficient coverage of intersectional bias (multiple protected attributes)
#### Manual testing processes that don’t scale
### YantraEthica Innovation Focus
#### Automated adversarial bias testing with counterfactual generation
#### Intersectional bias analysis using novel statistical methods
#### Comprehensive fairness metrics beyond traditional parity measures
#### CI/CD integration for automated bias testing in deployment pipelines
## 3. Runtime Bias Monitoring
### Current Limitations
#### Most monitoring is reactive rather than predictive[4][5]
#### Limited real-time capabilities due to computational overhead
#### Insufficient integration with MLOps platforms
### YantraEthica Innovation Focus
#### Predictive bias drift detection using time-series analysis
#### Low-latency monitoring optimized for production environments
#### Automated mitigation triggers when bias thresholds are exceeded
#### MLOps platform integration (MLflow, Kubeflow, AWS SageMaker)
## 4. Integrated Explainability
### Current Limitations
#### Explainability tools separate from bias detection workflows
#### Limited contextual explanations for bias-specific scenarios
#### Insufficient visualization for stakeholder communication
### YantraEthica Innovation Focus
#### Bias-aware explanations combining SHAP, LIME with bias-specific metrics
#### Interactive visualization dashboards for non-technical stakeholders
#### Causal inference methods to understand bias source relationships
#### Regulatory compliance reporting with automated documentation
